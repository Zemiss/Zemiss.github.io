Welcome to my personal home page! This is my space to showcase myself.

## About Me

Here is Bo Xie.

I am a member of the Class of 2024 at Nankai University, and I feel honored to be part of the inaugural Digital Intelligence Experimental Class. My current research interests primarily focus on Deep Learning

## Project Experience

Research Assistant | Image RAW-domain Enhancement | Sept. 2024 – Present

Model Reproduction: Successfully reproduced PMN (Enhancing Learnability for Low-Light RAW Image Denoising) and DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) architectures using Jittor, focusing on low-level vision tasks.

Optimization & Experimentation: Improved DnCNN performance and training stability by modifying the architecture to include a noise level map and an integrated noise estimation network

Data Processing: Gained hands-on experience in processing RAW sensor data, including handling Bayer patterns, bit-depth conversion, and noise modeling.

Technical Stack: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, Linux (GPU Server management).
